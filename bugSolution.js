```javascript
// Ensure that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured and imported.
// Check for conflicting CSS rules that might override your Tailwind classes.
// Ensure that your CSS file has correct import/export and Tailwind directives.
// Check that your class names are accurate and that no typos exist.

//Corrected example (Ensure correct import/export, and no other CSS is overriding it):
<div class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Hover me!
</div>
